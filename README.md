Issues
------
This production was based on my circa 2002-2003 Direct3D 8 3D engine, which
isn't in this repo yet. I will collect all the relevant code and add it in due
time.

Unfortunately this repository doesn't contain the original commit history,
because we weren't using any kind of source control when we wrote this.
